This is a collaborative effort of all Java developers in Open Source Community.

Feel free to come learn and use the codes for learning and teaching purposes.

we felt people don't really get to appreciate the Java language very much so we made this repo for people all over the world to learn and also add helpful Java codes that can help learners. :)
